= Exception handling

== The Throwable family

- Throwable
- Error
- Exception
- RuntimeException
- IOException
- SQLException
- ...

== Checked vs. unchecked exceptions

- Checked exceptions
- Must be handled or declared
- Usually indicates a problem outside of the program
- Subclasses of `Exception` that are not `RuntimeException`

- Unchecked exceptions
- Do not have to be handled or declared
- Usually indicates a problem inside of the program
- Subclasses of `RuntimeException` or `Error`

== Overriding methods with declared exceptions

- The exception declared in an overriding method cannot be more general than the exception declared in the overridden method
- The overriding method can declare no exceptions even if the overridden method declares exceptions

- Example

[source,java]
----
import java.io.IOException;//This will compile
class A {
    void foo() throws IOException {}
}

class B extends A {
    void foo() throws FileNotFoundException {}
}

// However, this will not compile since FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException
class A {
    void foo() throws FileNotFoundException {}
}

class B extends A {
    void foo() throws IOException {}
}
----

- If the overridden method does not declare any exceptions, the overriding method cannot declare any checked exceptions
- Example

[source,java]
----
class A {
    void foo() {}
}

class B extends A {
    void foo() throws IOException {} // This will not compile
}
----

- If the overridden method declares a checked exception but the overriding method doesn't throw any, it's not necessary to handle the exception in the overriding method

- Example

[source,java]
----
    class A {
        public void method() throws Exception {
            throw new Exception("Hello World");
        }
    }

    class B extends A {
        @Override
        public void method() {
            throw new RuntimeException("Hello World");
        }
    }

    public void test() {
        A a = new B();
//        a.method(); //## This will not compile

        B b = new B();
        b.method(); // ## This will compile
    }

----

== RuntimeException
- RuntimeException is the superclass of all exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine
- A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught
- Common subclasses of RuntimeException
    - ArithmeticException
        * Thrown when an exceptional arithmetic condition has occurred. For example, an integer "divide by zero" throws an instance of this class
    - ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
        * Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.
    - ClassCastException
        * Thrown to indicate that the code has attempted to cast an object to a subclass of which it is not an instance. For example, the following code generates a ClassCastException:

[source,java]
----
Object invalidInteger = "Hello World";
Integer x = (Integer) invalidInteger;
----


    - IllegalArgumentException
        * Thrown to indicate that a method has been passed an illegal or inappropriate argument.
    - NullPointerException
        * Thrown when an application attempts to use null in a case where an object is required. These include:
            - Calling the instance method of a null object.
            - Accessing or modifying the field of a null object.
            - Taking the length of null as if it were an array.
            - Accessing or modifying the slots of null as if it were an array.
            - Throwing null as if it were a Throwable value.
    - NumberFormatException
        * Thrown to indicate that the application has attempted to convert a string to one of the numeric types, but that the string does not have the appropriate format.
    - SecurityException
        * Thrown by the security manager to indicate a security violation.

- Example

[source,java]
----
// The following code will compile but will throw an exception at runtime
public class RuntimeExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 0;
        int c = a / b; // ArithmeticException
        System.out.println(c);
    }
}
----


== Checked exceptions
- Checked exceptions are the exceptions that are checked at compile time
- If some code within a method throws a checked exception, then the method must either handle the exception or it must specify the exception using throws keyword
- Example
    * FileNotFoundException
    * IOException
    * ClassNotFoundException
    * CloneNotSupportedException
    * SQLException
    * NotSerializableException


== Error
- An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a reasonable application should not try to catch
- Most such errors are abnormal conditions
- Example
    * ExceptionInInitializerError
    * StackOverflowError
    * NoClassDefFoundError
    * OutOfMemoryError
    * AssertionError


== Exception handling
- The try block contains set of statements where an exception can occur
- A try block is always followed by a catch block, which handles the exception that occurs in associated try block
- A try block must be followed by catch blocks or finally block or both
- It is not possible to have catch or finally block without a try block
- Example
[source,java]
----
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int a = 10;
            int b = 0;
            int c = a / b; // ArithmeticException
            System.out.println(c);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("ArithmeticException occurred");
        }
    }
}
----

=== Chaining catch blocks
- A try block can be followed by multiple catch blocks
- The catch block that gets executed is the one that corresponds to the exception thrown by the try block
- Example
[source,java]
----
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int a = 10;
            int b = 0;
            int c = a / b; // ArithmeticException
            System.out.println(c);
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("ArithmeticException occurred");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception occurred");
        }
    }
}
----
In this example, only the first catch block will be executed since the exception thrown by the try block is ArithmeticException
- When chaining catch blocks, the catch block for the subclass must come before the catch block for the superclass
- If one of the catch block is not reachable, the compiler will complain


=== Multicatch block
- A multicatch block is a catch block that handles more than one type of exception
- Example
[source,java]
----
public class ExceptionHandlingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            int a = 10;
            int b = 0;
            int c = a / b; // ArithmeticException
            System.out.println(c);
        } catch (ArithmeticException | NullPointerException e) {
            System.out.println("ArithmeticException or NullPointerException occurred");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("Exception occurred");
        }
    }
}
----
- The exceptions in a multicatch block must not be in the same inheritance hierarchy

=== The finally block
- The finally block always executes when the try block exits
- This ensures that the finally block is executed even if an unexpected exception occurs
- But finally is useful for more than just exception handling â€” it allows the programmer to avoid having cleanup code accidentally bypassed by a return, continue, or break
- Putting cleanup code in a finally block is always a good practice, even when no exceptions are anticipated
- When having the finally block, the catch block is optional
- If there are return statements in the try block, the catch block and the finally block, the return statement in the finally block will be executed just before the method returns
- The finally block will not be executed if the JVM exits while the try or catch block is being executed (e.g. System.exit() is called)

== Try with resources
- The try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources
- A resource is an object that must be closed after the program is finished with it
- The try-with-resources statement ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement
- Any object that implements java.lang.AutoCloseable, which includes all objects which implement java.io.Closeable, can be used as a resource
- The resources declared in the try block are effectively final, you cannot reassign them
- You can declare the resources outside of the try block, but you cannot declare them again in the try block
- Example
[source,java]
----
public class TryWithResourcesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("test.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException occurred");
        }
    }
}
----
- Behind the scene, try with resources is translated to the following code
[source,java]
----
public class TryWithResourcesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BufferedReader br = null;
        try {
            br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("test.txt"));
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                System.out.println(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException occurred");
        } finally {
            if (br != null) {
                try {
                    br.close();
                } catch (IOException e) {
                    System.out.println("IOException occurred");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
----
- As you can see, there is an implicit finally block that closes the resource
- As a programmer, you still can declare your finally block, however the implicit finally block will be executed first
- When writing try with resources, the resources are closed in the reverse order of their creation
- The catch block is optional when using try with resources
- You can declare multiple resources in the try with resources statement, the resources are separated by semicolons
- Example
[source,java]
----
public class TryWithResourcesExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("test.txt"));
             BufferedWriter bw = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter("test2.txt"))) {
            String line;
            while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
                bw.write(line);
            }
        } catch (IOException e) {
            System.out.println("IOException occurred");
        }
    }
}
----
- The resources declared are scoped to the try block, you cannot access the resources outside of the try block (e.g. in the catch block or the finally block)

=== Order of execution in try with resources
- The following is the order in which the resources are closed
- Consider the following code block
[source,java]
----
class SomeExamples {
    static class MyResource implements AutoCloseable {
        private String resourceName;
        public MyResource(String resourceName) {
            this.resourceName = resourceName;
        }
        @Override
        public void close() throws Exception {
            System.out.println("Closing " + resourceName);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (MyResource myResource1 = new MyResource("First");
             MyResource myresource2 = new MyResource("Second")) {
            System.out.println("In Try Block");
            throw new RuntimeException();
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println("In Catch Block");
        } finally {
            System.out.println("In Finally Block");
        }
    }

    //The order of output when running main:
    //In Try Block
    //Closing Second
    //Closing First
    //In Catch Block
    //In Finally Block

}

----

=== Throwing exception in resource
- If an exception is thrown in the try block and another exception is thrown while closing the resources, the exception thrown while closing the resources will be suppressed
- The exception in the try block is called the primary exception, the exception thrown while closing the resources is called the suppressed exception

- Example
[source,java]
----
class SuppressedExceptionDemo {

    static class MyProblematicResource implements AutoCloseable {
        private String resourceName;
        public MyProblematicResource(String resourceName) {
            this.resourceName = resourceName;
        }
        @Override
        public void close() throws Exception {
            System.out.println("Closing " + resourceName);
            throw new Exception("Exception in close method");
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (var resource = new MyProblematicResource("First")) {
            System.out.println("In Try Block");
            throw new RuntimeException("Exception in try block");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            System.out.println("Exception in catch block");
            for (Throwable t : e.getSuppressed()) {
                System.out.println(t.getMessage());
            }
        } finally {
            System.out.println("In Finally Block");
        }
    }
}
----
- Executing the code above will produce the following output
[source]
----
In Try Block
Closing First
Exception in try block
Exception in catch block
Exception in close method
In Finally Block
